# day-part-network

Network connectivity status through native APIs — online/offline, and the transport
(Wi-Fi, cellular, wired) where the platform reports it.

Parts are Day's headless extension unit — platform capability crates with no UI. This one
works in **any Rust program**; a Day app is not required.

## Part of Day

[Day](https://daybrite.dev) builds cross-platform apps from each platform's *real* native
widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android, GTK 4, Qt 6, WinUI, and ArkUI — from a single Rust
codebase. No web view, no bundled rendering engine: a `button("Save")` is an `NSButton` on
macOS and a Material button on Android.

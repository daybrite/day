# day-part-haptics

Haptic feedback through each platform's native API.

Impact and notification styles on iOS, vibration effects on Android, and trackpad taps on
macOS. `is_supported()` reports what the device can actually do, and playing a haptic
where there is no hardware simply does nothing — your app code never needs an error path
for a missing motor.

Parts are Day's small capability crates: no UI, just a plain Rust API over something the
platform already provides. This one works in any Rust program — you don't need a Day app
around it.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's real native widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets,
GTK 4, Qt 6, WinUI, and ArkUI — from one codebase. There is no web view and no bundled
rendering engine: when you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an `NSButton` and Android
shows a Material button.

# Forms (form / section / labeled)

> **Status: implemented** in `day-pieces` (portable: no per-backend renderer code beyond the
> section-card surface below). A settings-style grouped form: `form` holds `section` cards, and
> `labeled` rows inside them share one right-aligned label column across the whole form, with
> their controls starting on a common left edge. This is the aligned-labels look that settings
> UIs on every platform use.

## Authoring

```rust
form((
    section((
        labeled(tr("volume"), slider(volume).range(0.0..=100.0)),
        labeled(tr("enabled"), toggle(enabled)),
    ))
    .title(tr("sound")),
    section((
        labeled(tr("name"), text_field(name)),
        label(tr("hint")).font(Font::Footnote),   // sections take arbitrary pieces, not just rows
    )),
))
```

- `form(sections)` — a vertical run (spacing 16) that provides the shared label column to every
  `labeled` row underneath it, via the scoped environment ([docs/environment.md](environment.md)).
- `section(children).title(t)` — one grouped card: an optional footnote-style header above a
  rounded card (radius 10, content padded 14, spacing 10). Children are arbitrary pieces;
  `labeled` rows are just the ones that participate in alignment. A `section` also works
  standalone, outside any `form`.
- `labeled(text, control)` — one form row: the label sits right-aligned in the form-wide column,
  on the same text baseline as the control ([docs/baseline.md](baseline.md); centered instead when either side
  has no baseline, e.g. a toggle, or on a toolkit that reports none); the control starts at the
  column edge + 12. A control marked `.grow()`
  (text fields, sliders, or a `row(( … ))` wrapper) stretches to the row's remaining width;
  others hug their natural size. Outside a `form`, the column is just that row's own label width.

## The section-card surface

The card's background is **not** a hard-coded color: the container is realized with
`SurfaceRole::SectionCard` (`day-spec` `ContainerProps.role`), and each toolkit maps it to its
own theme-adaptive grouped-content material, so cards follow light/dark mode and platform
theming with no app code:

| Toolkit | Material |
|---|---|
| AppKit | `NSColor.quaternarySystemFillColor`, resolved per-draw in `drawRect:` (stays live across appearance changes) |
| UIKit | `tertiarySystemFillColor` + layer corner radius |
| GTK | libadwaita's `.card` style class |
| Qt | translucent neutral fill via a scoped stylesheet + `WA_StyledBackground` (no grouped-card palette role exists; a 12% gray adapts to any palette) |
| Android | `?attr/colorSurfaceContainer` (Material 3; falls back to `colorSurfaceVariant`) in a rounded `GradientDrawable` |
| XAML | `CardBackgroundFillColorDefaultBrush` theme resource |
| ArkUI | translucent neutral fill + corner radius |

## Layout: how alignment works

`form` plants a shared `Rc<Cell<f64>>` column width in the environment; each `LabeledLayout`
registers its label's unconstrained width during **measure** and reads back the running max in
**place**. Within one layout pass the enclosing stacks measure every child before placing any,
so by place time the max is final; alignment is consistent with no invalidation pass needed. Rows
report the *proposed* width as their size (labels align form-wide, controls may stretch), so a
growing column width never changes a row's measured size and can't oscillate the pass.

Vertically the row asks both children for their first text baseline ([docs/baseline.md](baseline.md)) and shifts
each down to the deeper of the two, so the label meets the control's inset text instead of the
middle of its box. The row is then as tall as that shared baseline plus the deepest descent below
it. When either side reports no baseline the row centers both, as before.

## Verification

- `day-pieces` mock e2e (`form_aligns_labels_and_sections_carry_the_card_surface`): two sections
  carry the card role + radius; label right edges align across sections; control left edges
  align across sections.
- The showcase uses forms on the **Controls**, **Canvas & shapes**, **Device & sensors**, and the four
  **Platform** pages; the walkthrough drives every control inside them on all targets,
  and the three screenshot variants (light / dark / fr) verify the card material adapts per
  theme on every toolkit in CI.

## Follow-ups

- `labeled` caption/footer affordances (secondary line under the control, iOS-settings style).
- Optional per-`section` label column (opt out of form-wide alignment for asymmetric sections).

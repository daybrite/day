# day-piece-media

A native media player piece for Day apps: `AVPlayerView` on macOS,
`AVPlayerViewController` on iOS, `QMediaPlayer` + `QVideoWidget` on Qt, ExoPlayer-backed
playback on Android — play/pause/seek from one Rust API.

Pieces are Day's extension unit: a crate with one Rust API and per-toolkit native
renderers, enabled per backend by cargo features (`day build` wires them automatically).

## Part of Day

[Day](https://daybrite.dev) builds cross-platform apps from each platform's *real* native
widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android, GTK 4, Qt 6, WinUI, and ArkUI — from a single Rust
codebase. No web view, no bundled rendering engine: a `button("Save")` is an `NSButton` on
macOS and a Material button on Android.

# day-piece-textarea

A multi-line native text editor for Day apps — `NSTextView` in a scroll view on macOS,
`UITextView` on iOS, `GtkTextView`, `QPlainTextEdit`, a Material `EditText` on Android —
with a reactive text binding.

Pieces are Day's extension unit: a crate with one Rust API and per-toolkit native
renderers, enabled per backend by cargo features (`day build` wires them automatically).

## Part of Day

[Day](https://daybrite.dev) builds cross-platform apps from each platform's *real* native
widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android, GTK 4, Qt 6, WinUI, and ArkUI — from a single Rust
codebase. No web view, no bundled rendering engine: a `button("Save")` is an `NSButton` on
macOS and a Material button on Android.
